# CommentApp
This Assignment I am creating a comment module. This modular approach will facilitate code reusability and ensure consistent functionality for comments on posts, profiles, and other entities.

The comments module will be designed to be highly adaptable and configurable, allowing for seamless integration and customization in different contexts.

## API

To enhance the authenticity of our implementation, we will utilize the json-server tool. This instrument enables the rapid creation of a simulated API. To begin, we will globally install the json-server package using npm and subsequently establish a db.json file within our project directory

## UserId
Here i manually added a user Id. This is because production applications have logged-in users, and typically, logged-in users can create and update comments

## Features of this application

* Add comments
* Delete comments
* Edit comments
